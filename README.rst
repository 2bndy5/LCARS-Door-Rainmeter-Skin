This is the home for developing my suite of rainmeter skins that are meant to imitate
the LCARS GUI as seen on computer in the Star Trek TNG television series. Most of these skins are in beta state. The list of skins included are:

* LCARS Door panel that opens up a window displaying more info about the system component. These components include

    * weather/date (including forecast and calendar)
    * audio volume
    * CPU monitor
    * RAM analysis
    * network (WLAN/LAN & Bluetooth device lists)
    * HDD display
    * music player & image of the day feeds 

There's also a settings skin to control variables specific to all skins. single 
click the starfleet symbol and the status buttons turn into customized links 
(edited in the door.ini skin's "LinkLabel" & "LinkAction" variables).

All skins are stable enough to test.
